# Remove the Youtube Recommended List
Escape the dark hole of youtube...by removing the hole altogether.
## Installation
* clone the repo and unzip.
* go to `chrome://extensions`.
* enable `Developer Mode` in the upper right hand corner. 
* finally, click `Load Unpacked` and select the cloned github repo. MAKE SURE TO BE IN THE FOLDER WITH THE ACTUAL FILES OR THE INSTALLATION WILL FAIL(manifest file missing or not found. on windows, that will look like this:` C:\Users\$username\$Downloads\Chrome-extension-remove-youtube-recommended-master\Chrome-extension-remove-youtube-recommended-master`
##Privacy
Obviously I'm not going to steal your data...I'm not smart enough to do that. But if you're paranoid(like me) you can limit the extension so it only has access to youtube.com. You can do that by clicking on `Details` of the extension, and scrolling down to `Site Access`. Change the option to `Specific Sites`, and input `youtube.com`. Happy productivity!
